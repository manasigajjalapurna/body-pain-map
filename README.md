This interactive Body Pain Map Tool is a lightweight HTML/JS web application for tracking and visualizing pain points on the body. Users can record pain level (1-10), type (muscle, joint, skin, other), location (using an interactive body outline), duration, and notes for each pain episode. The app includes filtering options by time frame, pain type, and body location, with the ability to export data to CSV and view simple reports. This application is built with jQuery and Bootstrap and runs completely client-side using the browser's local database for storage, which ensures all personal health data remains private on your device with no server required.
